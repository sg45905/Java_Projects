# Java_projects
This repository contains some small projects using Java Swing and demonstrating jdbc.

What you have to do is just create a simple java project in your Netbeans IDE and paste the .form file into the source packages folder in your project. Then right click on the libraries folder and click add jar/folder option. Then select the add external jar button and choose the mysql-connector-java.jar file provided in this repository, and then press apply.

Also for mysql connectivity download xampp server and install it on your system. From there start the apache and mysql services. Then open your browser and type localhost/phpmyadmin in the search bar. There create your database and tables. Thats it.
